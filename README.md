# What is Web-Crawler?

This little file named crawler.py contain function site_map, which can help Clarence find his way out.

## What should Clarence do to use it?
1. Just run your shell, find path where you have your crawler.py and use Python.
2. Import 'map_site' function.
3. Use map_site function, for example:<br />
site_map('http://0.0.0.0:8000/')<br />
4. And here you go Clarence! I hope that this will help you!
